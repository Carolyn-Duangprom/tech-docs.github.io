We see astrology in operation in everyday life all of the time. 

Here's an example I find interesting. When the two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan, the first bomb was a uranium bomb, the second, a plutonium bomb. Now Uranus transits in astrology indicate new, sometimes shocking, and always unexpected events.

Here was a bomb of a new and terrible kind that would change the ways of war forever. But it was followed by the plutonium bomb. In transits, Pluto represents
those events where your will has no impact, that spell the end of a current situation in no uncertain terms. The Japanese surrendered. The war ended. The
effects of both bombs brought irrevocable change, and end to an old way of being. Uranus the shock, Pluto the ultimate destroyer. When relationships are hit
by Uranus they have a chance to survive only when a totally new approach is embraced. If they end under Uranus transits, at least one party finds freedom, the
other is left shocked; the end may come swiftly, unexpected. 

Relationships hit by Pluto transits may end or change so they're unregnisable afterwards. There is no
going back and nothing you say or do will change how this works out. We consider the following for predicting events of such nature. Uranus or Pluto
transits to the personal planets, when they rule your relationship area (the 7th house) or Venus, or transits to the cusp of that house. When these planets are in
your 7th house in your birthchart they say something about the pattern of relationships in your life. Uranus there? You're better off in an unconventional
relationship. Pluto there? Be aware of power struggles. You're likely to be with people who act as transformers in your life, relationships usually end after long
periods of conflict and the end is the end. 

The trick to Uranus relationships? Unconventional is good. Don't get stuck in a rut. And Pluto? Don't think you can change that dark brooding partner! Accept him or her, or move on. And hold on to your own power in that relationship.
