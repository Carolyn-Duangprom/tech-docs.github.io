# Patience is power
(November 14th, 2019)

Mercury is currently retrograde again (Oct 31st - Nov 20th 2019). I’ve had quite a year! I accepted a job out of my home country (in a mercury
retrograde in March 2019!) and not surprisingly, it didn’t work out! But here I am, 6 months later on foreign shores, waiting to make the next step, to make a decision.

‘Patience is power.
Patience is not an absence of action;
rather it is "timing"
it waits on the right time to act,
for the right principles
and in the right way.’ 
Fulton J. Sheen (thanks to my teacher, Mirelma Du Plessis of Celestial Notebook)

Did I make a mistake? Maybe. But would I have made the move if not for accepting the job. Relocation was a dream. I took a chance. But I came prepared
for change along the way. Plan B. Life happens. Life does not stop because Mercury is retrograde. This time, all decisions are on hold. I’m taking a little time
out. Why did I make the decision knowing things could change? Well, as my astrologer said, with other planetary movements in my birth chart, disruption was
inevitable. Choose the sacrifice. So I moved. 

There’s the Pluto-Saturn conjunction approaching in January 2020. Saturn transiting my Sun (ruler of the house of
work, service, and the daily grind, as well as pets). That had to change. My animals came with me on this big move, and that was stressful to say the least.
Saturn transiting Mercury (Ruler of my 4th house of home and family and roots, and committed relationships). I relocated my family and home, moving out of a house I’ve lived in
for 18 years, and ended a 10 year relationship with my former employers. Something had to end. Since it’s Saturn, obstacles and delays and lessons were
inevitable. The last pass of Saturn conjunct to natal Mercury is on 19 November 2019. Saturn meets Pluto at 22 degrees of Capricorn early January 2020, forming
a trine (it’s fast, the trine can be positive, but you must know how to skate) to my 7th house of partnerships from my 11th of friendship groups and networks, as well as income from career. The Saturn / Pluto conjunction is there in everyone’s
charts but will be most impactful if it’s making aspects to any natal planets or angles. Since my birthday is a few days before this conjunction its part of the
pattern in the solar return. There’s often a question about relocating the solar return if you’re away from your birthplace at your birthday. In 2020, I should see how this works out practically and personally. It’s either in my first house of self
(chart set for Bangkok) and the actions I take are mine and powerful and deep and dramatic, or 4th house of roots, home and family (chart set for Cape Town),
and events in the family set the context for the year. Time will surely tell. Saturn requires you to overcome, Pluto asks you to submit. The stars incline, they do not
compel. There is potential and possibilities. It takes a great deal of study and intuition to make the diagnosis. Sometimes you have to wait and see.
