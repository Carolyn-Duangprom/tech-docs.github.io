# Portfolio

## Sharepoint / Confluence / Jira front end administrator
At CSG, while performing full duty as a technical writer for a software team, I managed a legacy SharePoint site, as well as the organization's Confluence and Jira on-premise instances. As the Confluence and Jira administrator, I provided support to a remote technical backend team, communicating with users around upgrades, investigating plugin requests, testing upgrades, and providing day-to-day desktop and project support to co-located and remote users. 


## Technical documentation

### OmiseGO
OmiseGO's publicly available documentation was published on GitHub. Content created and edited for OmiseGO consists of markdown files created either directly in GitHub, or using Docusaurus. 

* OmiseGO - [Using a browser for DAI transactions on the OmiseGO Network](https://github.com/omisego/dev-portal/blob/master/guides/dai_transaction_from_browser.md)
* OmiseGO [Network upgrade guide](https://github.com/omisego/plasma-upgrade-scripts)

### CSG International
At CSG, I initially created and managed documentation for the Optimized Routing product. When Optimized Routing was replaced by CSG Route, I transitioned to this team, which was initially entirely remote. I established a documentation process for the Route team, which involved identifying subject matter experts, analyzing the existing documentation set to determine which documents could be deprecated or merged to lower the documentation overhead, and then editing and updating legacy content. Project managers and the team were kept informed regarding document status by way of regular documentation status reports. 

Content was created and published using oXygen XML Editor with DocBook XML. Documents were published as Word files, PDF, and Webhelp, checked in with the code to a version control system, and shipped with the product. The CSG documentation is only available to customers. Anonymized content snippets will be provided.
