## Technical documentation

### OmiseGO
OmiseGO's publicly available documentation was published on GitHub. Content created and edited for OmiseGO consists of markdown files created either directly in GitHub, or using Docusaurus.

### CSG International
#### Documentation
For the first 2 - 3 years at CSG, I created and managed documentation for a locally developed telecoms product. When this product was replaced by a product developed by a remote team, I transitioned to the new team to establish a documentation process. This involved analysing the existing documentation set, identifying subject matter experts, developing a documentation process, identifying documents to be deprecated or merged to lower documentation overhead, and editing and updating legacy content. Project managers and the team were kept informed regarding document status by way of regular documentation status reports. 

Content was created and published using oXygen XML Editor with DocBook XML. Documents were published as Word files, PDF, and Webhelp, checked in with the code to a version control system, and shipped with the product. The CSG documentation is only available to customers. Anonymized content snippets will be provided.

#### Desktop support and system administration
While performing my role as a technical writer at CSG, I supported the remote backend technical team responsible for upgrades of the site's on-premise Confluence and Jira instances. This involved communicating with users, testing upgrades, investigating and requesting plugins, and providing day-to-day desktop and project support to co-located and remote users. Additionally, I managed a legacy SharePoint site, coordinated the delivery of handover material to global product enablement, and was the site representative for global quality documentation (such as documented software development processes).
