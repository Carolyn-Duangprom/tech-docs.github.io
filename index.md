# About me

I am a career software technical writer with an extensive background in various industries, including e-learning, business process management, document management, banking, telecoms, and most recently, Ethereum-based blockchain.

I've worked at IT start-ups and global multinationals, in both co-located and remote scenarios. I've loved engaging with technology professionals to translate and simplify complex concepts and procedures, resulting in content that's both useful and interesting. 

Before starting my professional career, I was an avid traveler, taking time off to work and backpack in Africa, Europe, and Asia. I actively sought out adventures, including cycling through Africa, working on a collective farm, and living for an extended period in a village in Thailand. 

As a remote learner in the 1990s, I studied while traveling, completing assignments along the way, and writing exams at my embassies abroad.
